Build a comprehensive product identifier tracking system that manages products at the individual IMEI/serial number level, with configurable tracking modes, complete change history, and delivery management capabilities.

DEVELOPMENT PHASES:

PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Stories 001-003)
Priority: HIGH - Must complete first
Duration: 2-3 sprints
- Database setup and core schema
- Project structure and basic web interface  
- Product version management with tracking configuration
Deliverable: Basic product management system

PHASE 2: CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Stories 004-006)
Priority: HIGH - Core business value
Duration: 3-4 sprints  
- Delivery management and stock entry
- Identifier search and detail views
- Inventory overview and stock tracking
Deliverable: Full inventory tracking capability

PHASE 3: CORRECTIONS & SWAPS (Stories 007-008)
Priority: MEDIUM - Error correction capabilities
Duration: 2-3 sprints
- Identifier swap (IMEI/Serial corrections)
- Product version swap (reclassification)
Deliverable: Complete correction workflows

PHASE 4: ENHANCEMENTS (Stories 009-012)
Priority: LOW - Advanced features
Duration: 4-6 sprints
- Clearance/bargain basement marking
- User authentication and authorization
- API integration and external connectivity
- Reporting and analytics dashboard
Deliverable: Production-ready system with full feature set

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: SQLite (POC) / PostgreSQL (Production)
- Frontend: EJS templates + Bootstrap 5 + JavaScript
- Authentication: Passport.js (Phase 4)
- API: RESTful endpoints with JSON (Phase 4)

STORY POINT SUMMARY:
- Phase 1: 10 points
- Phase 2: 18 points  
- Phase 3: 11 points
- Phase 4: 30 points
Total: 69 story points

TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS:
- 1 Full-stack developer can handle Phases 1-3
- Add frontend specialist for Phase 4 UI/UX
- Add DevOps engineer for Production deployment
- Consider QA engineer starting Phase 2

RISKS AND DEPENDENCIES:
- Database schema changes difficult after Phase 1
- User authentication affects all subsequent stories
- External integrations depend on available APIs
- Performance testing needed with real data volumes

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Track individual products from receipt to sale
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Error correction workflows for operational mistakes
- Real-time inventory visibility
- Integration ready for production systems
